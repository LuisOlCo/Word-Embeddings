# Word-Embeddings

Use different techniques for word embeddings:

1.- **Co-occurrence Matrix**, by counting the frequency of words that appear in the window of the center word we create co-ocurrence matrix, using SVD, the dimension of the matrix will be reducing in order to asign one vector representation to each word in the corpus
